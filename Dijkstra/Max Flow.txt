node link = amount of flow between current node and next node

go from end node to start node and list the max flow of the route
	store the first node link's flow to a variable
	if another nodes link is less than current max flow, set max flow to the lower number and store next node in bottleneck list
	loop until start node
		route all bottlenecks node
loop until all rotes from start to end are done
